# SingleAgent Documentation

Welcome to the SingleAgent documentation! SingleAgent is a powerful dual-agent system built on the OpenAI Agents SDK that combines intelligent code analysis with architectural planning capabilities.

## What is SingleAgent?

SingleAgent is an advanced AI-powered development assistant that features two specialized agents working together:

- **Code Agent (SingleAgent)**: Focuses on code analysis, implementation, debugging, and file operations
- **Architect Agent**: Specializes in system design, architecture planning, and high-level project structuring

Both agents are built on GPT-4 and feature advanced context management, entity tracking with SpaCy NLP, and comprehensive toolsets for development tasks.

## Key Features

- **Dual-Agent System**: Switch seamlessly between code-focused and architecture-focused agents
- **Advanced Context Management**: Persistent context storage with intelligent entity tracking
- **Rich Interactive CLI**: Built with prompt_toolkit featuring history, auto-suggestions, and streaming output
- **Comprehensive Toolsets**: Specialized tools for each agent covering file operations, code analysis, and architectural planning
- **OpenAI Agents SDK Integration**: Leverages the latest OpenAI agent capabilities
- **Entity Recognition**: SpaCy-powered NLP for intelligent context understanding
