# SingleAgent Multi-Agent System

Welcome to the SingleAgent multi-agent system! This project provides an interactive command-line environment where you can leverage multiple specialized AI agents to help you with coding, software architecture, and web research tasksâ€”all from a single interface.

## What is this?
This tool is a smart, context-aware assistant for developers. It combines several AI agents:

- **Code Agent**: Assists with code writing, editing, patching, linting, and more.
- **Architect Agent**: Helps you analyze and improve your software architecture, project structure, and design patterns.
- **Web Browser Agent**: Lets you search the web and fetch information from online sources.

You can switch between these agents at any time, and they share context so you never lose track of your work.

## Key Features
- **Multi-agent**: Switch between code, architecture, and web agents on the fly.
- **Context management**: The system keeps track of files, commands, chat history, and more.
- **Powerful tools**: Use built-in tools for code analysis, patching, project exploration, and more.
- **Interactive CLI**: Enjoy a modern command-line experience with auto-suggestions and history.
- **Persistent context**: Your work and context are saved between sessions.

## Who is this for?
- Developers who want an AI assistant for code and architecture.
- Anyone who wants to combine code, design, and research workflows in one place.
