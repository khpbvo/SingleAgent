# Quick Fix for main.py MCP Integration

## Change Required

In your `main.py` file, update the import and setup to use the fixed MCP agent:

### Before:
```python
# Import the MCP-enhanced agent
from The_Agents.MPCEnhancedSingleAgent import MCPEnhancedSingleAgent, CommonMCPConfigs, MCPServerConfig
```

### After:
```python
# Import the FIXED MCP-enhanced agent
from The_Agents.MPCEnhancedSingleAgent_fixed import MCPEnhancedSingleAgent, CommonMCPConfigs, MCPServerConfig
```

## Testing the Fix

After making this change:

1. **Start your system:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Switch to MCP mode:**
   ```
   !mcp
   ```

3. **Test MCP tool awareness:**
   ```
   !mcptools
   ```

4. **Test explicit MCP tool usage:**
   ```
   "Use the MCP filesystem tools to read the README.md file and tell me about its contents"
   ```

5. **Verify tool selection reasoning:**
   The agent should now explain:
   - Which tool it's using (MCP vs custom)
   - Why it chose that tool
   - What MCP tools are available

## Expected Improvements

With the fixed MCP agent, you should see:

- ✅ LLM explicitly mentions using MCP tools
- ✅ LLM explains tool selection reasoning  
- ✅ Better utilization of MCP server capabilities
- ✅ Clearer distinction between custom and MCP tools
- ✅ More comprehensive tool usage patterns

## If Issues Persist

If MCP tools still aren't being used properly, check:

1. **Model availability:** Ensure `gpt-4` model is accessible
2. **MCP server status:** Use `!mcpstatus` to verify servers are running
3. **Tool listings:** Use `!mcptools` to see what tools are available
4. **Logs:** Check `logs/mcp_singleagent.log` for errors

## Rollback Plan

If the fixes cause issues, simply revert the import:
```python
# Rollback to original
from The_Agents.MPCEnhancedSingleAgent import MCPEnhancedSingleAgent, CommonMCPConfigs, MCPServerConfig
```
