## Installation and Setup

### Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenAI API key

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**
```bash
cd SingleAgent
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Download the spaCy language model:**
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
```

3. **Set your OpenAI API key:**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here
```

4. **Start the program:**
```bash
python main.py
```

## Core Functionalities

The Code Agent helps you with:
- ‚úÖ Writing and debugging code
- ‚úÖ Reading and writing files  
- ‚úÖ Executing commands
- ‚úÖ Code reviews and optimizations
- ‚úÖ Error troubleshooting

#### Architect Agent Mode
The Architect Agent helps you with:
- üèóÔ∏è Designing system architecture
- üìã Generating documentation
- üîç Code base analysis
- üìä Project planning
- üéØ Best practices advice

### Switching Between Modes

```
!code       # Switch to Code Agent
!architect  # Switch to Architect Agent
```

## Important Commands

### Basic Commands
```
!help       # Show all available commands
!history    # View chat history
!context    # Show context summary
!clear      # Clear chat history
!save       # Manually save context
exit/quit   # Close the program
```

### Context Management
```
!entity     # View tracked entities
!manualctx  # Show manually added context
!delctx:label # Remove context item by label
```

### Special Functions
```
code:read:path          # Add file to persistent context
arch:readfile:path      # Analyze file with Architect Agent
arch:readdir:path       # Analyze directory structure
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Code Generation
```
User: Write a Python function to create a REST API with FastAPI

Code Agent: I'll create a FastAPI application for you...
[Agent generates code with explanation]
```

### Example 2: File Analysis
```
arch:readfile:src/main.py

[Architect Agent analyzes the file and provides detailed feedback on structure and improvements]
```

### Example 3: Project Structure Analysis
```
arch:readdir:src

[Architect Agent scans the directory and provides an overview of the project architecture]
```

### Example 4: Adding Context
```
code:read:config/settings.py

[Adds the file to persistent context so the agent can refer to it in future conversations]
```

## Advanced Features

### Intelligent Context Management
- **Automatic Entity Tracking**: The system automatically recognizes files, commands, and concepts
- **Persistent Context**: Important information is preserved between sessions
- **Token Management**: Efficient context management to stay within API limits

### Real-time Streaming
- **Live Response**: See answers appear in real-time
- **Tool Feedback**: Get immediate feedback when tools are being used
- **Progress Indicators**: See when the system is working on complex tasks

### Smart File Operations
- **Safe Writing**: Automatic backups and validation
- **Directory Scanning**: Intelligent analysis of project structures
- **Content Summarization**: Automatic summaries of large files

## Tips for Effective Use

### 1. Choose the Right Mode
- **Code problems?** ‚Üí Use Code Agent
- **Architecture questions?** ‚Üí Use Architect Agent

### 2. Use Context Wisely
```
# Add relevant files to context
code:read:src/models.py
code:read:config.py

# Then ask for help
"Can you optimize these models for better performance?"
```

### 3. Build Up Context
```
# Start with overview
arch:readdir:src

# Zoom in on specific components  
arch:readfile:src/main.py

# Ask for improvements
"How can I better structure this architecture?"
```

### 4. Use Historical Context
The system remembers:
- Previously written code
- Discussed architectural decisions
- Identified problems
- Applied solutions

## Workflow Examples

### New Feature Development
1. **Analyze current code:**
   ```
   arch:readdir:src
   ```

2. **Switch to Code Agent:**
   ```
   !code
   ```

3. **Implement feature:**
   ```
   "Add a user authentication system to my FastAPI app"
   ```

4. **Test and refine:**
   ```
   "Run the tests and fix any errors"
   ```

### Code Review Workflow
1. **Add code to context:**
   ```
   code:read:src/new_feature.py
   ```

2. **Switch to Architect:**
   ```
   !architect
   ```

3. **Ask for review:**
   ```
   "Review this code for best practices and potential improvements"
   ```

### Debugging Workflow
1. **Share error information:**
   ```
   "I'm getting this error: [error message]"
   ```

2. **Add relevant files:**
   ```
   code:read:src/problematic_file.py
   ```

3. **Ask for debugging help:**
   ```
   "Help me debug this error"
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Problems

#### "API Key Error"
```bash
# Check your API key
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY

# Set again if empty
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key
```

#### "spaCy Model Not Found"
```bash
# Download the model again
python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
```

#### "Context Too Large"
```
!clear          # Clear history
!delctx:label   # Remove specific context items
```

#### Agent Responds Slowly
- Clear unnecessary context with `!clear`
- Remove old files from context
- Check your internet connection

### Debug Information
The system saves logs in:
```
logs/main.log           # General logs
logs/singleagent.log    # Code Agent logs
logs/architectagent.log # Architect Agent logs
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Context Hygiene
- **Clear regularly** old conversations with `!clear`
- **Remove irrelevant** context items
- **Add only relevant** files to context

### 2. Effective Questions
- **Be specific** in your questions
- **Provide context** about what you're trying to achieve
- **Use examples** where possible

### 3. Tool Usage
- **Use arch:readdir** for project overviews
- **Use code:read** for specific files
- **Switch between modes** depending on your task

### 4. Workflow Organization
- **Start broad** (architecture overview)
- **Zoom in** on specific components
- **Test iteratively** during development

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How do I know which mode to use?**
A: Code Agent for implementation, Architect Agent for design and planning.

**Q: Is my context automatically saved?**
A: Yes, with every interaction. You can also manually save with `!save`.

**Q: Can I analyze multiple files at once?**
A: Yes, use `arch:readdir` for directory analysis or add multiple files with `code:read`.

**Q: How do I remove old context?**
A: Use `!clear` for everything or `!delctx:label` for specific items.

**Q: Can the system execute code?**
A: Yes, via the run_command tool, but this is done safely in containers where possible.

## Support and Feedback

For technical issues:
1. Check the logs in the `logs/` directory
2. Restart the program
3. Verify your API key and internet connection
